# READ.ME-Relief

## Description

README Relief is a command line README generator for people who do not want to deal with markdown syntax and just want to fill in their information. The application will give you a series of prompts in which after completed will give you a README file based on your input.

## Challenges


-I did not get the header links to link properly with their section.  
-The license badge generates but still shows the brackets from the code.  
-The application does not read my formatting such as # or --- and shows those characters on the readme.
